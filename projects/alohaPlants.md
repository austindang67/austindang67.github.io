Aloha Plants was created to help in the effort to combat the Hawaii Food Crisis and address the weakening biodiversity of plant life.

The website allows you to search and view different native plants, forums, and community projects. When searching for native plants it will provide information on how to grow native species and the specific areas to cultivate the plants.
