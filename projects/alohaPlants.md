Aloha Plants was created in an effort to combat the Hawaii food crisis and address the weakening biodiversity of plant life in the islands.

The website allows you to search and view different native plants, forums, and community projects. When searching for native plants it will provide information on how to grow native species and the specific areas to cultivate the plants.

I was responsible for the creation of the Add Plant functionality. This page of the website allows verified users to add plants to the Aloha Plants database:

Additionally, I worked on style and appearance for multiple pages on the website. I stylized the forum page to appear familiar as possible, following the typical layout of common forums such as Reddit:
