I will soon be working onboard the UHE (UH E-Sports) website development team. As a member of UH E-Sports myself, and a player on the Apex Legends Varsity team, it is a privilege to be able to apply and hone my web development skills for a school program that I'm passionate abut.

The UHE Website project will begin development when graphics and website layout have been approved by the administration. The website will be a hub for members of the organization in addition to being a warm welcome for anyone interested in the E-Sports program at UH Manoa.
