## Above all else..

Of all the concepts that I've learned in Software Engineering, the ideas that resonated the most with me outside of web application development are coding standards and design patterns.
These two concepts are principles of programming that can be applied to all forms of development. Coding standards are established principles for constructing sucessful programs and applications. Design patterns are similar in that they are proven ways in which computer scientists approach common problems. These concepts are built on the backs of countless lines of codes and even more errors. These concepts transcend web application development and are major parts of a successful computer scientist.

## Setting the standard

Coding standards are one of the first barriers to learning a new language and thus are completely applicable to different types of projects that may involve many languages and development tools. Coding standards refers to the established principles of writing code, particularly regarding syntax and formatting. They work to standardize code in a way that works best and reduces the amount of problems along the way. In our Software Engineering course, ESLint, a code analysis tool, was used to identify problematic patterns in code and help to maintain a functioning standard. Correct syntax always comes first as dictated by the machine. Code will not run if written in a way that a machine cannot understand, thus it is the first step to solid code. Coding standards are there to make sure that the house we are building doesn't fall apart when we decide that we want a window. They are important and different for every project, and thus it is one of the most valuable concepts that I've learned in Software Engineering.

## Thinking in patterns



Design patterns are another fundamental concept of programming that goes beyond web application development. Design patterns are repeatable solutions to familiar problems. They are tried and true approaches to commonly appearing problems in programming and it is unbelievably valuable to software developers to be familiar with them. Whether it be web application development, game development, UI design, there are established ways in all of these fields that work best when approaching a problem. Thus, it is a concept that sticks out in my Software Engineering journey.

##  What next?

With these concepts under my belt, the future for me lies in game development. I plan to master the coding standards of the engines I will be using, and master the countless design patterns of successful video games.
