Bootstrap 5 is my first framework and has proven itself to be another saver of time and energy. In two major ways the framework has eased my web development process.


## Making stylization quick

Fir starters, Bootstrap 5 is incredibly useful in its ability to streamline stylization in website development. My experience with Bootstrap so far has been tedious in learning
its possibilities, but conducive to my web design process. Being able to declare elements and simply add a couple of tag lines to manipulate their appearance has
saved me a lot of time that I would otherwise use stylizing them in a separate CSS file. 

## Plenty of neat resources

Additionally, Bootstrap 5 provides a bunch of components that would otherwise take time to code using raw HTML and CSS. Things such as navbars, buttons, and even
icons are all streamlined and available to those who use Bootstrap 5. It is incredibly convenient to create a Navbar with however many items you need and easily
manipulate the spacing using Bootstrap 5 and I can't imagine how much more annoying it would be to do it manually.

## What's next?

Even if it isn't the best framework, Bootstrap 5 has demonstrated that the usage of such can make web development so much more convenient. It has broadened my 
horizons for future frameworks, and I look forward to learning more about how frameworks can benefit programmers in more ways than convenience.
