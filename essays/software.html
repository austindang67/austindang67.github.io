Oftentimes we will make the future somehow more terrifying than the present. For myself, what I am scared of is missing out on what is happening in the now.
The title of Software Engineer is something that I want to be able to call myself without a doubt in my mind. Currently, I believe that I’m making as great of an effort
as I can to make this true.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-hope-to-accomplish-in-the-future">What do I hope to accomplish in the future?</h2>

<p>My goal in the Computer Science program is to eventually master the programming languages and interfaces that are essential to all Software Engineers.
I don’t necessarily want to memorize the ins and outs of every programming language and interface, but rather, I want to unlock a part of myself
that allows me to think creatively and draw myself towards simple solutions with every language.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-it-interest-me-at-all">Why does it interest me at all?</h2>

<p>Programming is science, but there is also beauty which makes it art. Software Engineering allows me to focus my creativity while fulfilling my desire to solve problems. Although there is a syntax and defined rules for how programs can be written, there is freedom in the approach to solving 
the problems that these programs are made for. Programming is an art in the way that Software Engineers think creatively to not only provide solutions, but also craft the machines that carry them. That is why Software Engineering fascinates me.</p>
